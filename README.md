## Preferred Working Style


<details>
I like working on my desk with my two monitors. They help set my zone and focus for longer hours while I am writing a code or brainstorming about something. I find it hard to work in a chilly room, love a warm room with a window and coffee ofcourse. I am in my optimal concentration zone in the mornings before lunch. I like to take a walk after lunch or in the evenings. I prefer to work alone or in team depending on the kind of task. I am not the best at scheduling things way ahead and sometimes miss updating my calendar. But I try to respond to teams message as quickle as possible.

## What Motivates Me


<details>
The thing that gives me energy at work is merely the passion for solving things and building a solution. A energinitic team/ team manager motivates me a lot. I love to learn and a good mentor is someone I look forward to. I am mostly self motivated but on my low days I tend to reach out to Yoga, exercise or an outdoor activity that brings back my direction of thinking. I like to read books and watch light hearted comedy too. I talk to my family and friends and they help me in all ways possible.
